# Light Meter
A semi Digital Light Meter (at the moment)

# Goals
To create a null/zero pointer measurement light meter.

simular to the Luna-Pro F light meter.

using anlog inputs where all values of exposure are already entered and a Â± EV value is the output.

# Progress
As of writing this i have stripped down a gossen Luna F and gotten an arduino UNO

i am using the existing light sensor from the gossen as it has a really wide Dynamic range.

i have stolen the idea of having basicly two base iso's as there are 4 outputs on the light sensor so i can have a high gain and a low gain (using risistors)


# To Do List
calibrate the light meter to get an acurate Lux/EV Value 

Set up the potentiomitor in the dile

Find a way to make the nedle move
